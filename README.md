## <span style="color:blue">**How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices?**</span>
## <span style="color:blue">**Does this same trend hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?**</span>
Based on our analysis, we can see that there is a general upward trend in both rental income and sales prices across San Francisco from 2010 to 2016. However, the growth in rental income has been slower compared to the growth in sales prices. We can see that neighborhoods with higher sale prices per square foot also tend to have higher gross rent, but this trend does not hold true for all neighborhoods. For example, the neighborhoods of Presidio Heights and Seacliff have some of the highest sale prices per square foot, but their gross rent is not as high as other neighborhoods like South of Market and Pacific Heights.


## <span style="color:blue">**What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing?**</span>
## <span style="color:blue">**Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?**</span>
Based on our analysis, it seems that the San Francisco real estate market has been experiencing steady growth in both rental income and sales prices, indicating that it may be a good time for investment in the city. However, it's important to note that the growth in rental income has been slower than the growth in sales prices, which may affect the profitability of a buy-and-rent strategy. As for specific neighborhoods to invest in, we suggest neighborhoods that have a combination of high sale prices per square foot and high gross rent, indicating a potential for high return on investment. Some neighborhoods that fit this criteria include Pacific Heights, Telegraph Hill, and South of Market. It's also important to consider other factors like vacancy rates, property taxes, and potential development projects in the area.
